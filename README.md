Muninn.jl is a package providing glacier mass balance models for [ODINN.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl). It currently includes basic temperature-index models, with 1 or 2 degree-day factors. In the future, it will also accommodate machine learning models to simulate glacier surface mass balance in a data-driven way, including some physical constraints.
